This document describes how to speed up LaTeX compilation.

## Using a pre-compiled preamble.

Assume your document is called `barbar.tex`. (Your document filename must not contain any spaces)

1. Ensure you have the `mylatexformat` package installed.
2. Type `\endofdump` into the source file, before `\begin{document}` and any dynamic parts of your preamble.
3. Run (in terminal/cmd) exactly

```
pdftex -ini -jobname="foofoo" "&pdflatex" mylatexformat.ltx barbar.tex
```

4. Comment out the all the document before `\endofdump` using `%`.
5. Add the line `%&foofoo` in line 1 of your document.
6. Run `pdflatex barbar.tex` in the normal way.


For the Super Working Paper, this reduces the compilation from 5.3 s to 4.0 s
