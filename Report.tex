\begin{document}

\begin{overview}
This is the overview. 
The word \textbf{Overview} appears in the contentspage at \verb=\contentspage= as an unnumbered entry.
Set over two columns, the first and last baseline of each column is set on matching baselines. 

(But only if the overview is large enough!) 

The first line of the overview starts at a fixed vertical position but its height is determined by the constraint of matching the baselines.
In particular if the overview is too large, it will overflow the page.

Footnotes are not permitted.
